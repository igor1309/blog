# Post #1 Flight Search Structural Components

Computers follow orders, people don‚Äôt [^1]. APIs have strict languages, but natural languages are extremely complex - there are multiple ways to express even the simplest thing. So how could I make an app [^2] that queries some API to get flight data without forcing me to loop through a boring form with dozens of pickers [^3], and let me just type some letters and probably numbers into the search field? Something like that was dancing in my head while I was browsing App Store and trying app after app waiting for my son‚Äôs airplane to take off.

What if I pretend that I have some knowledge about how people search for flights? [^4] If they type numbers, that should be a flight number, right? Well, unless it‚Äôs just one digit, of course. And no one would look for airport or city or country names with digits [^5]. Two digits? Hm‚Ä¶ Nope, skip it. Three or four? Sure, take it.

# –¢–£–¢ –£–ñ–ï –û–ß–ï–ù–¨ –î–ï–¢–ê–õ–¨–ù–û –î–õ–Ø –ü–ï–†–í–û–ì–û –ü–û–°–¢–ê –ò –û–¢–ö–õ–û–ù–ò–õ–°–Ø –û–¢ –¢–ï–ú–´ –ö–û–ú–ü–û–ù–ï–ù–¢–û–í!!!

One letter? No way.
Two letters? Well, no, thank you very much.
But actually it‚Äôs a ‚Äúyes‚Äù - two letters are used for airline codes: __Continental Airlines__ 2-letter code is __CO__, __United Airlines__ code is __UA__.

Three letters? Here is a lot. Airport code, city code, airport name, airline name, city/country, etc.

More than three letter words? Those should be the names for sure: of the airline/airport/city/country.

What if there is ‚Äúfrom XXX‚Äù or ‚Äúto YYY‚Äù? [^6] XXX and YYY should be an airport or a city. Much less likely the country.

So, it does feel like enumeration:

```swift
enum Token {
    // numbers
    case flightNumber(Number)
    // "from XXX"
    case origin(String)
    // "to YYY"
    case destination(String)
    // other words with 3 or more letters
    case other(String)
}
```

What we do here is lexer // add link to wiki


__Regular expressions.__

One way to construct lexer is to use Regular Expressions. They are super powerful and working with them (at first) nicely fit TDD (Test Driven Development) - just create a new class in a new file in the test target [^7] and start adding tests for small code snippets using RegEx you write in the same file.

But as your set of regular expressions you intend to use in the lexer grows and complexity of these regular expressions grow as well, it becomes quite difficult to thoroughly test and even understand them.  And, unless you regularly use them, in two-three month you most certainly would need sufficient extra time to force-refresh your memory.

# –í–°–¢–ê–í–ò–¢–¨ –°–Æ–î–ê –ù–ï–ë–û–õ–¨–®–û–ô –ü–†–ò–ú–ï–† –° RegEx

There is a much better, and canonical, way to construct the lexer - parsers. You might have seen them a lot, and if not probably it‚Äôs time to refresh your memory a little bit [^8].
# WHAT ITHER LINKS FOR PARSERS DO I HAVE?
For a deeper dive I highly recommend a great collection of posts (text + video, subscribers only) [Parsers](______________________) at [Point Free](__________) [^9]
# ADD LINKS!!!
I like it so much that I‚Äôve decided to use their open-source library _______ to create my lexer.

[^1]: Or at least we used to think this way.
[^2]: "Use AI or Google" - yeah, sure, maybe next time üññ.
[^3]: Okay, three pickers with endless options are as bad as a hundred üò´.
[^4]: do.not.short.Google(Alphabet).
[^5]: Luckily [humanity so far](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_places_with_numeric_names) is not [that creative](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52557291).
[^6]: I‚Äôll postpone localization problems for a while.
[^7]: I usually create a new Swift Package and "play" in the test target. I would love to use Playgrounds but I haven't found a nice way to XCTest in playgrounds. Hopefuly, [Swift Playgrounds 4 ic oming](https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/29/heres-a-first-look-at-the-new-swift-playgrounds-4-ahead-of-official-release/).
